# Hello!
I am going by the pseudonym codenamerey here on Github. In real life, I am Lee. 

Right now, I am learning a plethora of subjects: design patterns, Rust, Operating Systems, and physics! They're challenging, but hey, I like challenges!

Check out my repositories to see some of my works!

'Til next README.md update,
